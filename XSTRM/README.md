# XSTRM

This Ruby application development platform was built for Eastern Michigan Univeristy's IA 480 - SQL Database Security class to be able to replace the XAMPP requirments with variants to better suite Ruby web application development. XAMPP stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P) and Perl (P); and XSTRM stands for Cross-Platform (X), Sinatra (S), Thin (T), Ruby (R) and Mysql (M). Whilst Mysql isn't exactly my favorite, I needed it for the class. So, yeah. At least I'll have Ruby.
