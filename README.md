Class work for an SQL Security class where we are asked to build up our own applications in PHP. I've been allowed to use Ruby, thankfully! So, I'll be storing all of the code required for class on here as a backup and as reference for myself / other rubyists to learn some fun things by writing some purposely bad things. Ruby research!

## Login Page

Generated a silly login page with [Boostrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Validator](http://1000hz.github.io/bootstrap-validator/) along with a little bit of custom javascript to determine if the username and password match the hardcoded values on the page.

#### Security Note

This login page is obviously a bit of a joke. But, it looks good. :)
